amazong - Query Amazon prices, report on lower prices
========================================================

2012-04-10,
Complete overhaul.  Moved credentials away to ~/.amazongrc, limited
queries to 10 at-a-time, switched to reporting of lower prices only by
default and introduced the 'full' switch that reproduces the old
behaviour of simply printing the complete list of products and prices.
Had to throw away all previous commits because of the in-code
credentials that I used.  Just goes to show ya.

Github-ready.

2011-11-07, Turns out, the Associate ID thing comes with a new API and
newer versions (than Debian's current .59) of Net::Amazon have me
covered.  I installed a local version of it with

    perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib -e 'use local::lib "~/local"; CPAN::install(Net::Amazon)'

and added a 'use lib' to amazong.
